# School District Analysis
## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to examine each school district's performance, spending, and size. We wanted to see if there was a correlation between these data points. 
## Results: 
•	We found that out of the 15 schools, the average math score was 78.9% and the average reading score was 81.9%. There is a total of 39,170 students across these 15 schools. Overall there are 64.9% of students passing. 

•	When we replace the ninth grader's math and reading scores it affects Thomas High School's scores significantly by dropping it down to 66.9% passing math and 69.66% passing reading. This leads to only 65% passing students overall. 

•	We notice that there is not a direct correlation between spending and the percentage of students passing. There are many examples where we see the school budget over $1million, $2million, and $3million but only 50% of the student population is passing.

## Summary: 
Overall we found out that charter schools tend to have more students passing than district schools. We also see higher math scores in these charter schools than the district schools. However the district schools are close to the charter schools on a reading score scale. The smaller the school, the higher the percentage of students passing. As the school size increases the percentage passing decreases.
